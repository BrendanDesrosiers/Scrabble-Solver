# Scrabble-Solver
A simple program that can play the popular game "Scrabble"

To run:
1. Download the latest release
2. Tinker within the `main.py` file
3. Run the program using a python interpretter

Sorry, but I am terrible at making Python GUIs, so instead, I opted to leave the code and allow you to experiment as you would like ;D
